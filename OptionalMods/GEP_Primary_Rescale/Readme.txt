## GEP_Primary_Rescale

GEP_Primary_Rescale is an optional config that rescales the GEP_Primary solar system to 2.5x its normal size. This is intended to increase game difficulty and provide a more realistic gaming experience by making stock rocket parts feel less overpowered. Delta-v requirements are increased to about 1.6x what they are at stock scale.

To install GEP_Primary:

1. Download and install Grannus Expansion Pack per the installation instructions.

2. Copy [GEP Download]\Optional Mods\GEP_Primary\GameData\GEP_Primary to [KSP]\GameData\ .
