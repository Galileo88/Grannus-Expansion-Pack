## GEP_Rescale

GEP_Rescale is an optional config that rescales the GEP solar system to 2.5x its normal size, for use in combination with either GEP_Primary or the JNSQ planet pack. Rescaling is accomplished without the use of Sigma Dimensions. If GEP is used in any installation where Sigma Dimensions is used to perform rescaling, then GEP_Rescale should not be installed.

To install GEP_Primary:

1. Download and install Grannus Expansion Pack per the installation instructions.

2. Copy [GEP Download]\Optional Mods\GEP_Rescale\GameData\GEP_Rescale to [KSP]\GameData\ .
