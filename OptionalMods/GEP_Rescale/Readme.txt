## GEP_Rescale

GEP_Rescale is an optional config that rescales the GEP solar system to either 2.5x or 10x its normal size. Rescaling is accomplished without the use of Sigma Dimensions (these mods should never be used in combination with Sigma Dimensions). GEP also works with GPP and/or JNSQ in any of the following installation options, using the appropriate GEP, GPP and JNSQ rescale mods to provide size compatibility.

  * GPP + GEP                                    |
  * JNSQ + GEP                                   |
  * JNSQ + GPP + GPP_Secondary + GEP             | + applicable Rescale mods (scales should match)
  * GEP + GEP_Primary                            |
  * GEP + GEP_Primary + GPP + GPP_Secondary      |

For any other combination of planet packs, rescaling should be performed using Sigma Dimensions without GEP_Rescale.

To install GEP_Rescale:

1. Download and install Grannus Expansion Pack per the installation instructions.

2. Drill down to [GEP Download]\Optional Mods\GEP_Rescale\ and select either Rescale_2.5X or Rescale_10X.

3. Copy/merge the selected GameData folder into your KSP install.

4. If applicable, download and install GPP and/or JNSQ and the appropriate rescale mods per their instructions.

5. Delete the Kopernicus cache, i.e. the *.bin files located within each planet pack's Cache folder.

6. It is recommended that for GEP_Primary at 10x scale the DSN modifier in game difficulty be set to 4.
