## GEP_LegacyTerrain

1. GEP_LegacyTerrain is an optional add-on that reverts GEP's terrain textures to those used prior to KSP v1.8. This is required for anyone playing the most current GEP on KSP 1.7.3 or older, or for anyone who simply prefers the old textures.

2. To install, copy/merge [GEP Download]\Optional Mods\GEP_LegacyTerrain\GameData\GEP to [KSP]\GameData\ .
