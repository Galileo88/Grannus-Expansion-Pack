## GEP_Primary

GEP_Primary is an optional add-on that turns GEP into a primary star system, with Grannus as the central star and Nodens the home world. If GEP + GEP_Primary is installed in combination with GPP + GPP_Secondary, then GPP is added as a secondary star system orbiting Grannus. GEP_Primary is not recommended for beginner players.

To install GEP_Primary:

2. Copy [GEP Download]\Optional Mods\GEP_Primary\GameData\GEP_Primary to [KSP]\GameData\ .
