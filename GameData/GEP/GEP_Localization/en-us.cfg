		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Airmed.cfg
			#LOC_Bodies_Airmed_displayName = Airmed^N
			#LOC_Bodies_Airmed_description = The innermost moon of Sirona, Airmed has lived a violent life that has left it battered and scarred. And what's with the weird two-toned surface? Despite its oddities, Airmed is the best place to be if you want to gaze back at its impressive parent planet. Just be sure to bring a camera.
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TropicalLowlandsDisplayName = Tropical Lowlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TemperateLowlandsDisplayName = Temperate Lowlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TropicalMidlandsDisplayName = Tropical Midlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TemperateMidlandsDisplayName = Temperate Midlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_HighlandsDisplayName = Highlands

			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_DarkenedMidlandsDisplayName = Darkened Midlands

			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_PolesDisplayName = Poles

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Belisama.cfg
			#LOC_Bodies_Belisama_displayName = Belisama^N
			#LOC_Bodies_Belisama_description = Belisama is the lone moon of the planet Nodens, with an orbit that barely fits inside the small sphere of influence. A lesser body would have likely escaped Nodens' clutches eons ago, but massive Belisama clings so tightly to its parent that the two are mutually tidally locked, each always showing the same face to the other.
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_FlatsDisplayName = Flats
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TropicalLowlandsDisplayName = Tropical Lowlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TemperateLowlandsDisplayName = Temperate Lowlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TropicalMidlandsDisplayName = Tropical Midlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TemperateMidlandsDisplayName = Temperate Midlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_HighlandsDisplayName = Highlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_PolesDisplayName = Poles

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Brovo.cfg
			#LOC_Bodies_Brovo_displayName = Brovo^N
			#LOC_Bodies_Brovo_description = The second and largest moon of Sirona, Brovo is big enough to be a planet it its own right. Having a substantial atmosphere, and a surface colored in browns and beiges, it leaves us wondering whether Brovo is a rocky and dusty world, or a frozen world covered in ice. Or perhaps something unimagined?
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TropicalCraquelureDisplayName = Tropical Craquelure
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TemperateCraquelureDisplayName = Temperate Craquelure
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TropicalLowlandsDisplayName = Tropical Lowlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TemperateLowlandsDisplayName = Temperate Lowlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TropicalMidlandsDisplayName = Tropical Midlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TemperateMidlandsDisplayName = Temperate Midlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_HighlandsDisplayName = Highlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_MajorCratersDisplayName = Major Craters
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_PolesDisplayName = Poles

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Cernunnos.cfg
			#LOC_Bodies_Cernunnos_displayName = Cernunnos^N
			#LOC_Bodies_Cernunnos_description = Falling short of planet status, Cernunnos is officially classified a dwarf planet. It is an icy world orbiting far from the warmth of its sun. Is it alone in this part of space, or is it only the largest of a family of small bodies orbiting on the outskirts of this planetary system?
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TropicalLowlandsDisplayName = Tropical Lowlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TemperateLowlandsDisplayName = Temperate Lowlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TropicalMidlandsDisplayName = Tropical Midlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TemperateMidlandsDisplayName = Temperate Midlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_HighlandsDisplayName = Highlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_SouthPolarHillsDisplayName = South Polar Hills
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_NorthPoleDisplayName = North Pole

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Damona.cfg
			#LOC_Bodies_Damona_displayName = Damona^N
			#LOC_Bodies_Damona_description = Damona is the smallest and most distant moon of the planet Sirona. It is a gray and pockmarked world, having one prominent feature that betrays a violent episode in Damona’s not too distant past.  It's likely a barren orb, but could Damona surprise us?
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TropicalLowlandsDisplayName = Tropical Lowlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TemperateLowlandsDisplayName = Temperate Lowlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TropicalMidlandsDisplayName = Tropical Midlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TemperateMidlandsDisplayName = Temperate Midlands

			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_ImpactBasinDisplayName = Impact Basin
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_PolesDisplayName = Poles

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Epona.cfg
			#LOC_Bodies_Epona_displayName = Epona^N
			#LOC_Bodies_Epona_description = Epona is a sizeable planet located in a part of space distant enough from its red dwarf sun that little light and heat reaches this far. While Epona almost certainly has a frozen exterior, does a warm geologically active heart beat beneath its icy crust? And if so, could that warm, wet interior provide an environment conducive for life?
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TropicalLowlandsDisplayName = Tropical Lowlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TemperateLowlandsDisplayName = Temperate Lowlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TropicalUplandsDisplayName = Tropical Uplands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TemperateUplandsDisplayName = Temperate Uplands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_HighlandsDisplayName = Highlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_GrandPeaksDisplayName = Grand Peaks
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_CratersDisplayName = Craters
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_VolcanoesDisplayName = Volcanoes
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_PolesDisplayName = Poles

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Nodens.cfg
			#LOC_Bodies_Nodens_displayName = Nodens^N
			#LOC_Bodies_Nodens_description = Nodens is a large terrestrial planet right smack in the middle of its star's Goldilocks zone. It avoids the usual fate of a planet this close to its star by being tidally locked to its large moon rather than Grannus, thereby producing a day-night cycle. But does all that mean Nodens is a Gael-like world teeming with flora and fauna, or will it disappoint by being bleak and lifeless? This gem is undoubtedly near the top of any list of places to visit.
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_SaltySeasDisplayName = Salty Seas
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_FreshWaterDisplayName = Fresh Water
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_ShoresDisplayName = Shores
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TropicalLowlandsDisplayName = Tropical Lowlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TemperateLowlandsDisplayName = Temperate Lowlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TropicalMidlandsDisplayName = Tropical Midlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TemperateMidlandsDisplayName = Temperate Midlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_HighlandsDisplayName = Highlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TundraDisplayName = Tundra
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_IceCapsDisplayName = Ice Caps

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/RAB-58E.cfg
			#LOC_Bodies_RAB-58E_displayName = RAB-58E^N
			#LOC_Bodies_RAB-58E_description = RAB-58E is a small moonlet orbiting on the edge of Epona space. Its unusual orbit suggests that it may be a captured body, but where did it come from? Is it a tiny rock or a frozen snowball? Until we can a closer look, it's anyone's guess.
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_LowlandsDisplayName = Lowlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_EasternHighlandsDisplayName = Eastern Highlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_WesternHighlandsDisplayName = Western Highlands

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Rosmerta.cfg
			#LOC_Bodies_Rosmerta_displayName = Rosmerta^N
			#LOC_Bodies_Rosmerta_description = Rosmerta is the inner moon of the planet Epona. Small, frigid, airless, and, in all likelihood, lifeless, Rosmerta doesn't exactly sound like prime real estate.  But she seems rather lonely and ignored, so perhaps we should pay the lady a visit.
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TropicalLowlandsDisplayName = Tropical Lowlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TemperateLowlandsDisplayName = Temperate Lowlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TropicalMidlandsDisplayName = Tropical Midlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_TemperateMidlandsDisplayName = Temperate Midlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_HighlandsDisplayName = Highlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_PolesDisplayName = Poles

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Sirona.cfg
			#LOC_Bodies_Sirona_displayName = Sirona^N
			#LOC_Bodies_Sirona_description = While relatively small as far as gas giants go, Sirona is the undisputed boss of her planetary neighborhood. Her disc reflects enough of Grannus' light toward Gael that her existence has been known ever since the first modern telescopes were turned in her direction. Always the faithful companion to Grannus, Sirona never strays far from his warm embrace. Her faint light can be seen moving to and fro in a never ending dance.
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_DarkTropicalBandsDisplayName = Dark Tropical Bands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_LightTropicalBandsDisplayName = Light Tropical Bands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_DarkTemperateBandsDisplayName = Dark Temperate Bands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_LightTemperateBandsDisplayName = Light Temperate Bands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_DarkPolarBandsDisplayName = Dark Polar Bands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_LightPolarBandsDisplayName = Light Polar Bands

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Taranis.cfg
			#LOC_Bodies_Taranis_displayName = Taranis^N
			#LOC_Bodies_Taranis_description = Taranis is a rocky planet orbiting very close to its parent star. Its two hemispheres stand in stark contrast; the sun baked side hot enough to melt rock, the other side frozen in perpetual darkness. Any encounter with this tiny world is certain to be a high-speed affair. If you plan to stay be sure to pack plenty of delta-v, as well as sunblock.
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_MagmaSeaDisplayName = Magma Sea
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_MagmaShoresDisplayName = Magma Shores
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_ScorchedLowlandsDisplayName = Scorched Lowlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_MidlandsDisplayName = Midlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_HighlandsDisplayName = Highlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_DarkSideMidlandsDisplayName = Dark Side Midlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_DarkSideHighlandsDisplayName = Dark Side Highlands
			#LOC_Bodies_Biome_PolesDisplayName = Poles
