		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Taranis = Astronomers are startled to discover a new planet buried deep within the bright glare of nearby Grannus. Taranis, you couldn't hide forever!
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Nodens = That newly found point of light has all the characteristics of a new planet. Could it be? Yes it is! Let's welcome Nodens to the family of known planets.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Belisama = One point of light orbiting another point of light, must be a moon. This one orbits the planet Nodens, and we're naming it Belisama.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Sirona = That steady point of light observed orbiting Grannus can be nothing short of a new planet. This one appears large, likely a gas giant. We have christened her Sirona.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Airmed = Airmed peaks her head around what appears to be another body. She tries to hide but can't escape the sensitive eye of our most advanced electronic sensors.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Brovo = A pale orange light is spied orbiting what appears to be another body. The name Brovo is added to the list of celestial bodies populating this far away solar system.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Damona = It wasn't easy to spot, but the faint light of the small moon Damona is tracked making repeated circuits of the what appears to be another giant planet.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Epona = What, another planet? The roster just keeps growing ever larger. After some debate, the Astronomical Union has decided to name this one Epona.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Rosmerta = And all this time we thought Grannus didn't have any grandchildren. Not anymore as astronomers have spotted the faint nearby light of the tiny moon Rosmerta.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_RAB-58E = After initial reports of its sighting were dismissed, astronomers now agree the elusive speck is a moon. Until we think of a name we're dubbing it RAB-58E.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Cernunnos = Spotting faint Cernunnos has taken the difficult task of planet hunting to a new level. This one must be really far away, and tiny, and... well, you get the idea.
