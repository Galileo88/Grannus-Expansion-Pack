## TO INSTALL:

1.  Download and install Galileo's Planet Pack (https://github.com/Galileo88/Galileos-Planet-Pack/releases).  Be sure to carefully follow all the GPP installation instructions.  Any dependencies or optional mods required or used by GEP will be installed when you install GPP.  It is recommended that you confirm the correct operation of GPP before installing GEP. 

2. Download Grannus Expansion Pack 0.8

3. Copy from [Download]\GameData\ to [KSP]\GameData\ the folder GEP and all its contents.

## Recommended mods with support for or by GEP

  * Environmental Visual Enhancements - min-version: 1.2.2-1
  * Scatterer - min-version: 0.0320b
  * Distant Object Enhancement
  * ResearchBodies

## Known Issues

Because KSP does not support multiple stars, some mods or mod features will not work correctly with GEP. Mods known to have multiple star issues include:

  * EVE - eclipse shadows rendered incorrectly; EVE eclipses are excluded from GEP, though other EVE features work.
  * PlanetShine - lighting effects rendered incorrectly; GEP provides no support for PlanetShine.
  * SCANsat - day-night terminator displayed incorrectly, other SCANsat features work.
